Writing out a full recipe seems like a lot of time spent not especially productively,
so here's the briefest version of making biscuit-drop pot pie:

Make a roux, add veggies (frozen carrots, peas, green beans)
Make biscuits. Treat them like pie crust.
Filling in square pan, biscuits cover over. Bake.
